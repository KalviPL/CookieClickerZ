# ðŸ”§ Configuration

CookieClickerZ can be configured using Yaml files. The files are created under `/plugins/CookieClickerZ`, after you started the server once with the plugin installed.

In the main config file `config.yml` you can change the language, configure the Anticheat and tweak other general settings.

The `clicker.yml` contains the clicker blocks added with `/cc clicker` command.
