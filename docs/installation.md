# ðŸ’» Installation

**1. Download the Plugin:**

To install CookieClickerZ on your Server, you first have to download the latest version of CookieClickerZ from a trusted platform such as [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/cookieclickerz), or any other **official** platform.

**Be alert:** This plugin is only available on its official [GitHub](https://github.com/KartoffelChipss/CookieClickerZ), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/cookieclickerz), and [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/KartoffelChipss/CookieClickerZ) pages.

**2. Upload:**

After downloading the `.jar` file, upload it to the `plugins` directory of your server.  If your host provides you with a panel, this directory is often found under a section named `Files` or `File Manager`.

**3. Finalizing**

Before you can play with CookieClickerZ, you'll have to restart the server once, so the plugin can be loaded.

If you want to check, that CookieClickerZ is installed correctly, you can either try to use the `/lsz` command or use `/pl` and check if CookieClickerZ is green.
